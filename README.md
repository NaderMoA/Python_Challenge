# Python_Challenge
I started with the bank section.I calculated the Total Months and Total Net and the only problem i had was that i didnt understand what the net change is so i reached out to AskBCS and they told me it's the difrences of each month and they hint me that i should use an extra next() in order to reserve a place holder for calculating my net change for the first month. so i am using his formula for that: prev_net = row[1] and then i started buliding the rest of the codes. till my results matched that of the image shown in the assignment. then i started the poll section and got to the results in terminal. the i started building the codes to write them in the text file. i had a problem with generating the text in seperate lines, one of the classmates provided a website that it was saying by using the \n at the end i can get the results in seperate lines in the text file.
